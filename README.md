# Generation-Game-Jam-Platformer
A procedurally generated platformer made with Arcade for the Timathon monthly challenge (August 2020).

In order to download and run the game, there are multiple options:
If you want to run it directly with Python, just clone the repo, install arcade (pip install arcade), and you should be good to go.
To run the game, just run main.py

Otherwise, if you don't want to install python, you can either (Windows only):

A. Download the "Compiled Platformer --onedir.zip" folder, and run the 'main.exe' file, located in right in the first folder..

B. For an even simpler setup, download "Compiled Platformer --onefile.zip", which contains main.exe and chimpmunk.dll. Just run main.exe, and the game will run.
    The caveat to this approach is that saving DOES NOT work. So your progress will be reset each time.
